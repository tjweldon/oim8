# oim8!

A dumb little peer to peer cli chat app that is designed to work over the local network.

Things to be aware of:
 - This is a toy project; it is not secure, it is not scalable.
 - It likely won't get finished.

## Motivation

 1. Fun.
 2. I wanted to learn about how UDP works.
 3. Making mistakes while trying to re-invent the wheel with regards to peer to peer networking (and hopefully learn something).

 
## Usage

Don't. It's probably broken anyway.
